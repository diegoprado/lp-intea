    "paragraphs": [
      "Intea was born from the personal experience of Dr. Charles Drumond, a defender of social rights and inclusion, and a father of three children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Faced with the challenges of caring for and monitoring his children's development, Charles was motivated to create a solution that would facilitate communication and tracking. In 2022, after discovering that he, too, is autistic, his empathy and desire to drive change grew even stronger. He then founded the Minas Gerais Association for the Defense of Autistic Rights (AMMDA) and created Intea, an innovative digital platform that integrates health information and therapies, promoting collaboration among professionals and empowering families in caring for individuals with ASD."
